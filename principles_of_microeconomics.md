## Chapter 1. Ten Principles of Economics

To lay the foundation of this book, the author introduces ten principles of economics in the fist chapter, and further groups these principles into three topics: how people make decisions, how people interact with others, and how the economy works as a whole.

People make decisions because they are always facing trade offs: choosing something and giving up other things. In the mind of people, the cost of something is usually evaluated as what you would give up to get it. Rational people think values and costs at the margin, which are defined as the relative values and costs given what you already have and pay. People's decisions are also affected by incentives. Little change of the environment, such as policies, may lead people to make opposite decisions.

The economists believe all people participating in economic activities can benefit from it, and markets are a good way to guide economic activities in most cases. It is still under great debates whether governments are needed for markets, but sometimes it does promote equality and efficiency of markets. 

On a larger scale, a nation's economy, such as the efficiency of producing goods and services from unit resource, determines the living quality of its people. This section also introduces two fundamental known facts: printing too much money leads to price rising (inflation), and inflation/unemployment is a short-term trade-off for the society.
